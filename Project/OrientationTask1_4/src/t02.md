Arrival Count (A): Tracks the number of clients that have arrived at the service point. Updated as each new client arrives.

Completed Count (C): Tracks the number of clients that have completed their service. Updated every time a client finishes being serviced.

Response Time (Ri): Directly observed for each customer as the time from their arrival to the completion of service. This value is updated per customer and can be used to calculate the average response time.

Waiting Time (W): Maintained by summing up the waiting times for all customers, and updated each time a customer finishes being serviced.

Average Queue Length (N): Derived from the waiting time and the total time, this is calculated periodically or at the end of the simulation to give an overview of the queueâ€™s behavior during the service period.
