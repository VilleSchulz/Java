//Task 1: Grocery List Manager
//In this exercise, you will create a Java program that simulates a simple grocery list manager using ArrayList.
// The program will allow users to perform various operations on a grocery list, such as adding items, removing items,
//displaying the list, and checking if a specific item is present.
//Instructions:
//Create a Java class named GroceryListManager.
//Inside the GroceryListManager class, declare an ArrayList to store the grocery items.
// Use the following code to create the ArrayList:
//import java.util.ArrayList;
//
//public class GroceryListManager {
//    private ArrayList<String> groceryList = new ArrayList<>();
//
//    // Add methods here
//}
//Implement the following methods inside the GroceryListManager class:
//

//Add a few items to the grocery list.
//Display the grocery list.
//Check if a specific item is present in the grocery list.
//Remove an item from the grocery list.
//Display the updated grocery list.
//Example Output:
//Grocery List:
//1. Apples
//2. Milk
//3. Bread
//
//Is "Milk" in the grocery list? true
//
//Removing "Milk" from the list...
//
//Updated Grocery List:
//1. Apples
//2. Bread
//Note: You are encouraged to enhance the exercise by adding input validation and error handling to handle cases such as adding duplicate items, removing non-existent items, and so on.
