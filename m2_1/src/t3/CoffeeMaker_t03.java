package t3;//Task 3: Create CoffeeMaker class
//
//A coffee maker has a selector for coffee type (normal/espresso) and a selector for coffee amount (10â€“80 ml).
// It also has an of/off switch that behaves in the same way as TV of/off switch. Coffee type and amount selectors
// behave like TV channel switch, i.e., they can only be changed when the device is on, and the device remembers the
// selections even when it is switched off.
